# review Wave 2 code and run acceptance testing for backend device management CRUD...

## Summary
review Wave 2 code and run acceptance testing for backend device management CRUD...

## Goal
review Wave 2 code and run acceptance testing for backend device management CRUD...

## Deliverable
Governed implementation artifacts, verification evidence, and cleanup receipts

## Constraints
- Do not bypass the fixed six-stage governed runtime.
- Do not widen scope silently beyond the frozen requirement document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Requirement document is frozen before execution.
- Execution plan exists before implementation.
- Verification evidence exists before completion claims.
- Phase cleanup receipt is produced.

## Product Acceptance Criteria
- Requirement document is frozen before execution.
- Execution plan exists before implementation.
- Verification evidence exists before completion claims.
- Phase cleanup receipt is produced.
- The delivered output must satisfy observable behavior implied by the frozen goal and deliverable, not only internal runtime progress.
- Full completion wording is allowed only after downstream delivery truth is passing.

## Manual Spot Checks
- None required beyond automated verification for this task unless the execution scope expands to a user-visible or interactive flow.

## Completion Language Policy
- Full completion wording is allowed only when governance truth, engineering verification truth, workflow completion truth, and product acceptance truth are all passing.
- `completed_with_failures`, degraded execution, or pending manual actions must be reported as non-complete states.
- If manual spot checks remain pending, the run must be described as requiring manual review rather than fully ready.

## Delivery Truth Contract
- Governance truth: requirement, plan, execution, and cleanup artifacts remain traceable and authoritative.
- Engineering verification truth: targeted verification passes or fails explicitly; silence does not count as success.
- Workflow completion truth: planned units, delegated lanes, and specialist outputs reconcile back into the governed plan.
- Product acceptance truth: observable deliverable behavior satisfies frozen acceptance criteria before full completion language is allowed.

## Artifact Review Requirements
No additional artifact review requirements were frozen for this run.

## Code Task TDD Mode
TDD mode: not_applicable
Decision source: runtime_inference
Reason: No host decision or runtime inference required code-task TDD evidence for this task.

## Code Task TDD Evidence Requirements
No code-task TDD evidence requirements were frozen for this run.

## Code Task TDD Exceptions
No code-task TDD exceptions were frozen for this run.

## Baseline Document Quality Dimensions
No baseline document quality dimensions were frozen for this run.

## Baseline UI Quality Dimensions
No baseline UI quality dimensions were frozen for this run.

## Task-Specific Acceptance Extensions
No additional task-specific acceptance extensions were frozen for this run.

## Research Augmentation Sources
No research augmentation sources were frozen for this run.

> Fill the anti-drift fields once here. Downstream governed plan and completion surfaces should reuse them rather than restate them.

## Primary Objective
review Wave 2 code and run acceptance testing for backend device management CRUD...

## Non-Objective Proxy Signals
- single sample pass only
- current test green only
- demo success only

## Validation Material Role
validation_only

## Anti-Proxy-Goal-Drift Tier
Tier C

## Intended Scope
scenario_specific

## Abstraction Layer Target
_author_to_declare_

## Completion State
partial

## Generalization Evidence Bundle
- cases: []
- note: add independent evidence before generalized completion claims

## Non-Goals
- Do not treat M/L/XL as user-facing entry branches.
- Do not introduce a second router or control plane.

## Autonomy Mode
interactive_governed

## Assumptions
- Interactive clarification is allowed if unresolved ambiguity materially changes implementation.

## Evidence Inputs
- Source task: review Wave 2 code and run acceptance testing for backend device management CRUD port allocation frpc config sync-config implementation with findings and verification evidence
- Intent contract: intent-contract.json
- Runtime input packet: runtime-input-packet.json

## Runtime Input Truth
- Governance scope: root
- Root run id: 20260511T081817Z-30349ca8
- Entry intent: vibe
- Requested stop stage: requirement_doc
- Requested grade floor: none
- Selected pack: orchestration-core
- Router-selected skill: vibe
- Runtime-selected skill: vibe
- Route mode: pack_overlay
- Route reason: unattended_auto_route_override
- Confirm required: False

## Specialist Decision
- Governed `vibe` must explicitly record whether specialist execution is happening, stayed advisory, or remained unresolved before closeout.
- Decision state: approved_dispatch
- Resolution mode: approved_dispatch
- Notes: Bounded specialist recommendations were surfaced and promoted into effective approved dispatch.

## Specialist Recommendations
Raw router candidates remain in `runtime-input-packet.json` for audit and are not frozen as user-facing requirements.
Only host-adopted or effective approved specialist dispatch is shown here; non-adopted candidates and stage assistants stay out of the requirement surface.
- Adopted Skill: code-reviewer
  Role: specialist_assist; native usage required: True; preserve workflow: True
  Binding: profile=verification; phase=verification; lane policy=serial; parallel in XL=False
  Write scope: specialist:verification; review mode: checkpoint_after_step; execution priority: 90
  Reason: top ranked specialist candidate from pack 'code-quality' via fallback_task_default
  Required inputs: bounded specialist subtask contract, frozen requirement context, relevant source files or domain artifacts
  Expected outputs: bounded specialist findings or code changes, verification notes aligned with the specialist skill
  Verification expectation: Preserve the specialist skill's native workflow, boundaries, and validation style.
- Adopted Skill: peer-review
  Role: specialist_assist; native usage required: True; preserve workflow: True
  Binding: profile=verification; phase=verification; lane policy=serial; parallel in XL=False
  Write scope: specialist:verification; review mode: checkpoint_after_step; execution priority: 90
  Reason: top ranked specialist candidate from pack 'science-peer-review' via fallback_task_default
  Required inputs: bounded specialist subtask contract, frozen requirement context, relevant source files or domain artifacts
  Expected outputs: bounded specialist findings or code changes, verification notes aligned with the specialist skill
  Verification expectation: Preserve the specialist skill's native workflow, boundaries, and validation style.

## Specialist Consultation
These are specialists resolved for discussion-time handling under governed `vibe` before this requirement doc was frozen. Depending on policy, they may be consulted live or routed for direct current-session loading.
